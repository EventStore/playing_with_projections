# playing-with-projections

Clojure playground for playing with projections workshop

Client requirement: Java 1.8, Clojure 1.8.0

Build tool : [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

You should use Leiningen to import the only lib used : [org.clojure/data.json](https://github.com/clojure/data.json)

You can run the main with : *lein run "../data/xxxx.json"*
You can go TDD with *lein test* (there is a first test implemented).
You can explore with *lein repl*.

For time, the setup push you to use the Java 8 Date Time API with info added to the events (but you could use anything you want).

Have fun !
