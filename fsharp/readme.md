# F# Client

## Running locally
Run `start.cmd` on Windows or `start.sh` on Linux/Mac (with Mono and FSharp installed) to restore dependencies.

Open `client.fsx` file (with Visual Studio on Windows or VSCode on Linux, Mac or Windows), select the code and hit Alt+Enter to run it in F# interactive (REPL, you need ionide extension on VSCode).

Instead of using these IDE, you can run `fsi client.fsx` on Windows or `fsharpi client.fsx` on Linux.

## running with docker
`docker-compose up`
